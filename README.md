## 🎯 Why Was This Software Created?

The **FEAFAA** (Finite Element Airport Pavement Analysis for Aircraft) software, version 3.0, was originally developed as a specialized tool for **airport pavement analysis** by research institutions and Airport Technology R&D organizations.

Built on the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**, it enabled accurate structural analysis of runways, taxiways, and aprons under the heavy loading conditions of modern aircraft.

### 🔧 Customization for Civil Engineering

In the new **FEAFAA 4.0**, developed and customized by **Ebrahim Shafiei (EbraSha)**, the software goes beyond airport applications and is now adapted for **specialized use in Civil Engineering**. This version is specifically designed for the analysis of **rigid roller-compacted concrete (RCC) pavements** under the loading of **heavy vehicles and support equipment**.

As a result, civil engineering students and researchers can leverage FEAFAA 4.0 to perform **advanced structural analyses, durability assessments, and optimized pavement design studies**.


### ✅ Issues Resolved

Problems in this version compared to the previous version have been resolved, with significant improvements in software performance and stability.
